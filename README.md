# A modular Hugo theme

Puzzled a made-from-scratch theme and the result of experimentations with Hugo `partials`, Go templating and [Bulma.io](bulma.io).

Challenge was to template as much as possible, to create a theme layout that can be changed any time with a few lines, thanks to `shortcuts`, directly in Mardown, instead of using partials.

Basically, using `shortcuts` as components and `hugo.toml` as much as possible to create something easy to use and deploy.
